# Woody woodpacker

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/leonmariotto/binutils/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/leonmariotto/binutils)

## Whatsup

Implement a packer, that is a binary obfuscater. Woody take an ELF64 in parameter and 
output an elf64 that have the same behavior but is encrypted.

Woody add functions at the start of binary to decrypt it and launch it.

TODO:
- packer should parse its own elf, output it + a custom data section containing the encrypted elf and some symbols modified.
- boot_mode, elf_data, elf_size and key symbols must be overrided by packer.
- issue with dumped binary, a constant value has changed.


## Submodules 

There is some submodule in there, so run:
```
git submodule update --init
```
When cloning repository.

There is some dependency :
<ul>
    <li>uv</li>
    <li>cppcheck</li>
    <li>graphviz</li>
    <li>gcovr</li>
</ul>

This is mainly a reimplementation of nm in C, with some options readelf-like. </br>
Work in progress for binary injection. </br>
I use this repository to test some C developments tools and workflow. </br>

## Building

Assembly, preprocessing, object code.

### Callgraphs

The submodule gcc_graph_tool is used to produce a simple callgraph from gcc output.</br>
This could be extended with stack usage for each function.</br>
Screenshot of callgraph :

## Static Analysis

### MISRA checker

The MISRA checker is a plugin of cppcheck. Configurations files is located under misra/ folder. </br>
The misra Makefile rules build a report with single line per warning (can be used to
easily check if there is more error in CI and reject PR)

## Testing

### Unit test

unit_test.mk is a simple Makefile that allow to build a single source file along with a test source file.</br>
It build object ready for coverage, run binary and use gcovr to produce coverage output.</br>
Test is run with CMocka, it output a JUnit xml.</br>
```
make -f unit_test.mk
```
unit_test.mk is made to be controllable by caller script (TBD).
